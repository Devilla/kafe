# How Kafé serves content

Kafé uses the Next.js feature [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) to serve content. As a result, we are able to serve content incrementally and only as needed. This is an essential feature for providing fast performance. Upon the first request, we can use a CDN to deliver content as a static file in the cache.

## How Kafé stores content

The Kafé application can retrieve content from different sources: The Kafe application is based on Next.js, and serves content from three different sources:

- The file system.
- Raw files hosted on GitHub.
- From decentralized storage such as [Arweave](www.arweave.org).

### Local Environment

As you work on the guide for Kafe by running locally via _yarn dev_, the content is pulled directly from the local filesystem. The authors can see the content while it is being developed locally at [`localhost:3000/learn/<guide_slug`>](http://localhost:3000/learn/guide_slug).

### Preview Environment

Due to Vercel's [limitation of serverless function sizes](https://github.com/vercel/community/discussions/103), we are unable to serve content directly from that filesystem. Instead of preloading all the content of the repository, our approach is to use GitHub's raw CDN as a proxy to access the filesystem on demand. Through preview links, authors and reviewers who work on the project can see the content as it is being developed before it is fully published to Arweave.

### Production Environment

The production environment is where the content is published to and retrieved from Arweave and Ceramic. Upon approval from the review team, a guide is automatically published to Arweave and its metadata is stored on Ceramic. The builderdao.lock.json file is also updated at this stage.
